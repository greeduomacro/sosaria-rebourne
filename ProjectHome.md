# Overview #
Sosaria Rebourne is a 2D role playing game similar to Ultima 3 through 5 written in BASH shell script. It uses VT100 escape codes to produce color output, and uses 5x3 character ASCII art for graphics.

Work on this project has stopped. This was a fun experiment into what you can do with BASH. If you thought this was cool you might also like my earlier BASH experiment: http://code.google.com/p/akalabeth-rebourne/

Currently the game will load an endless series of battles between a party of three and some Mongbats (and the occasional Troll). Melee and ranged combat is implemented as well as equipment changing and items. Try out the Flaming Oil and Flaming Oil Keg. Fun for the whole family!

Also, press D at any time to save your party.
